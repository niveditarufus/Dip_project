The objective of the project is to estimate the rotation of two images from the polar mapped amplitude spectra. The proposed method is to estimate the translational shift in the transformed coordinate system by employing 1D phase correlation with adaptive line selection which will reduce the computation cost by 50%. An unofficial implementation of the paper:
